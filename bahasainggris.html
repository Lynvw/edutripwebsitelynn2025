            <h2>The Amazing National Palace Museum!</h2>
            <p>National Palace Museum is a museum located in Taiwan's capital city, Taipei. On the 6th day of the edutrip, I visited there with my friends, teachers and tour guide. It took around 1 hour from my hotel to arrive there by a bus. Right there; i took a look at an ancient Chinese artifact that was brought to Taiwan by Chiang Kai Shek, who is the 1St President of Taiwan. National Palace Museum is a very amazing museum that has so many interesting ancient Chinese artifacts. </p>
            <h3>The door entering Chinese Ancient History</h3>
            <p>National Palace Museum is the biggest museum in Taiwan. It is also very famous of being the second biggest museum in the world. Not only that it has a very big building. The museum is surrounded by big hills making it very scenic, it felt like watching a very beautiful painting. There is a very big field In Front of the museum building, which consists of 4 floors. When i first entered from the museum lobby, i saw a very big sun yat sen monument that looks like Chiang Kai Shek which is the first president of Taiwan Jade cabbage and Meat shaped stone is the most known chinese artifacts that are. stored in the National Palace Museum.</p>
            <h3>Exploring the amazing artifacts</h3>
            <p>The National Palace Museum showcases 3000 different artifacts that will be changed every 3 months because it has a total of 65000 artifacts. I explored the whole building with one of my friends. The biggest artifact we found in the museum is the statue of Buddha which has a very tall height that reaches 2 floors of the building. The tour guide also told us about the most famous artifact showcased in this museum which is the jade cabbage, but sadly when we went there the jade cabbage wasn't shown because like I said that every artifact will be changed after 3 months showcased. Explored ancient Chinese calligraphy, Chinese ink stone snowcase and Chinese accessories back then.</p>
            <h3>My memorable experience in the National Palace Museum</h3>
            <p>The National Palace Museum told me so much about Chinese History making it very interesting for me knowing that I am likely interested in Chinese History. The tour guide explained so much about the history in a room that is surrounded by a videotron. it felt like bursting pixels come up to my eyes. We were also guided throughout the museum. After exploring the museum, we were given some time to visit the souvenir store and ended up buying some stuff there. One of the interesting souvenirs I bought there is a playing card with Chinese drawing in It. Lastly, we were brought outside of the museum to take some pictures. It was such a fun experience because me and my friends got to take pictures while seeing the very beautiful scenic view.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the National Palace Museum is the best museum I've visited because it holds so many interesting ancient Chinese artifacts. Finis museum is very recommended for tourists that are interested in Chinese & Taiwan history. After visiting the National Palace Museum I learned so many new things about Chinese & Taiwan artifacts, especially the ancient artifacts. Overall, the National Palace Museum must be on your bucket list when you visit Taiwan!</p>
